# Akka HTTP Starter

This project contains a set of running examples on how to use [Akka HTTP](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.2/scala/http/introduction.html) for building applications with different requirements. The examples range from a simple echo server to servers with logging, authentication, file uploads and streaming. There's also some examples on [Akka Streams](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.2/scala/stream/stream-introduction.html).

Clone the repository, run some examples and start hacking your own!

This material is related to a series of talks on using Akka HTTP in production, from pre-release to 2.4.2. You can find the slides and related links in [http://gamsd.com/talks](http://gamsd.com/talks).
